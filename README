#  Credit Card Fraud Detection using Gradient Boosting

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using the **Gradient Boosting Classifier** from Scikit-learn.  
It covers data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and **hyperparameter tuning** with Grid Search.  
The model’s performance **before and after tuning** is compared to show how optimization improves accuracy and recall.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is **creditcard.csv**, which contains anonymized credit card transaction data.  
Each record represents a transaction with the following characteristics:
- **Features:** Numerical features (V1, V2, …, V28) obtained by PCA  
- **Amount:** The transaction amount  
- **Class:**  
  - `0` → Normal transaction  
  - `1` → Fraudulent transaction

##  Project Workflow

1. **Importing Libraries**
   - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
   - `sklearn` (model, metrics, GridSearchCV)

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Check shape, info, missing values, and duplicates  
   - Visualize class imbalance using bar and pie charts  

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Drop duplicate records  
   - Rename `Class` → `Fraud`  
   - Split data into training and testing sets  

4. **Model Training (Before Tuning)**
   ```python
   GBM = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=29)
   GBM.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = GBM.predict(X_test)
